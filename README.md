## Estimands in epigenome-wide association studies

### simulation.R
The simulation.R file contains the code for the simulation and the figure 1. Attention, the default values are set very low to avoid a runtime of hours.

### simulation_convergence_beta_reg.R
The simulation_convergence_beta_reg.R file contains the code for the simulation of the convergence rate in the supplementary material. Attention, the default values are set very low to avoid a runtime of hours.
